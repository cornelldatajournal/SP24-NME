# NME Mini project

Hi, CDJ Class of Spring 2024!

Now that you have the toolkit for cleaning, exploring, analyzing, visualizing and modelling data, you can now complete a data project!

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the whole process, from gathering data yourself to producing interpretation and stories!

## Instructions

Here are the main steps:
1. Choose a topic of your interest
2. Find a dataset
3. Clean and manipulate the data
4. Explore and visualise the data
5. Model with linear regression (or otherwise)
6. Write a short conclusion

Please complete all of the steps with Jupyter Notebook.

### 1. Choose a topic of your interest

You can basically choose any topic of interest: be it sports, urban transportation, healthcare, COVID, global trade, AirBnBs, etc.

Feel free to extend or explore a related topic to your CDJ or coursework projects!

### 2. Find a dataset

For this assignment, you will likely just obtain a publicly available dataset. There are so many possibilities, but [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) has an extensive list of data sources for a large range of domains/industries. Other places to look are [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) or various government open data portals (e.g., [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/))

If you want to - you could combine two different datasets using joining or other techniques! Examples include combining census data and COVID-19 case data.

Also, feel free to use datasets that you already have - e.g., from coursework or past research.

**But**, there is one requirement for the data: It has to have **at least 50 rows** and **more than 2 variables** (note the number of columns may not necessarily equal the number of variables - as some columns may be e.g., ID, indices)

### 3. Clean and manipulate the data

*Related session: NME #1*

Please do the necessary cleaning and manipulation:
- Selecting Data: filtering, subsetting
- Combining Data: concatenating, joining
- Deal with missing data: identify them, imputation/fill with some value
- ...

### 4. Explore and visualise the data

*Related session: NME #2*

First, compute some summary statistics: mean/mode/median, standard deviations, etc. to get a general grasp of the data. 

Then, visualise the distribution of one or more variables with matplotlib/seaborn: box plots, bar plots, and histograms.

After exploring the distribution of single variables, calculate the correlation between variables and visualize with scatterpots.

### 5. Model with linear regression

*Related session: NME #3*

Please fit the data into a model - most likely a linear regression model (either single explanatory variable or multiple regression) as this is what we talked about. However, if you know other models (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree), feel free to do those too! 

Evaluate the model using the appropriate technique. If you are doing a linear regression, also include what are the parameters and intercept.

### 6. Write a short conclusion

Please write a one-paragraph conclusion summarizing your findings through exploring, modelling or visualizing the data. Point out any interesting observations.
