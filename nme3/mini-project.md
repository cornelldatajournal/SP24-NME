# NME Mini project

Hi, CDJ Class of Spring 2024!

Now that you have the toolkit for cleaning, exploring, analyzing, visualizing and modelling data, you can now complete a data project!

The goal of this assignment is to familiarize you with the whole process, from gathering data yourself to producing interpretation and stories!

## Instructions

Here are the main steps:
1. Choose a topic of your interest
2. Find a dataset
3. Clean and manipulate the data
4. Explore and visualise the data
5. Model with linear regression (or otherwise)
6. Write a short conclusion

Please complete all of the steps with Jupyter Notebook.

### 1. Choose a topic of your interest

You can basically choose any topic of interest: be it sports, urban transportation, healthcare, COVID, global trade, AirBnBs, etc.

Feel free to extend or explore a related topic to your CDJ or coursework projects!

### 2. Find a dataset

For this assignment, you will likely just obtain a publicly available dataset. There are so many possibilities, but [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) has an extensive list of data sources for a large range of domains/industries.

Other places to look are [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) or various government open data portals (e.g., [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/))

Also, feel free to use datasets that you already have - e.g., from coursework or past research.

**But**, there is one requirement for the data: It has to have **at least 50 rows**

### 3. Clean and manipulate the data

*Related session: NME #1*

Please do the necessary cleaning and manipulation:
- Deal with missing data
- Data transformation

### 4. Explore and visualise the data

*Related session: NME #2*

### 5. Model with linear regression

*Related session: NME #3*

### 6. Write a short conclusion

Please write a one-paragraph conclusion summarizing your findings through exploring, modelling or visualizing the data. Point out any interesting observations.
