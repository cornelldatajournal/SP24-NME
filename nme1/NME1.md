## Homework

As said at the end of the session, please complete the Numpy and Pandas skills drill on the CDJ GitHub before our next NME on Sunday, March 17th.

If you never worked with Github before, you can follow this guide on our Notion for how to download the assignment. I have also created a guide on how to use Jupyter Notebooks on Notion. In addition, I am currently working on cheat sheets and quick guides for data manipulation on Notion - stay tuned!
